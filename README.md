- 👋 Hi, I’m @cipaolini!
- 👀 I’m interested in human language and how speakers make their decisions while communicating. 
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD candidate in Linguistics at the KU Leuven (Belgium). I'm part of the QLVL (Quantitative Lexicology and Variational Linguistics) group, 
      under the supervivion of Prof. Benedikt Szmrecsanyi. My PhD project is "How much does meaning matter? A fresh look at grammatical alternations" (2021-25).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on methodologies for distributional semantics and quantitative lexicology. I'm eager to learn more about statistical modelling 
      applied to variational linguistics and, more in general to language analysis.
